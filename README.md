# Machine Learning Project: Notebook to Production

## Overview

This project serves as a comprehensive guide to constructing an end-to-end machine learning architecture suitable for deployment on a serverâ€”whether local or cloud-based.

## Objectives

The goal is to provide a clear exposition of the typical workflow in production-level projects, including but not limited to:


- **Modular Coding**: Crafting code in a manner that promotes readability and reusability.
- **Logging**: Ensuring that all actions and transactions are properly recorded.
- **Model Preservation**: Techniques for saving and retrieving machine learning models efficiently.
- **Pipeline Construction**: Establishing a streamlined process for predictions, allowing for direct input into predefined fields on a frontend interface.

## Deployment

The culmination of this project is the deployment phase, where the machine learning model is integrated with a frontend website, facilitating user interaction and prediction generation through a user-friendly interface.
